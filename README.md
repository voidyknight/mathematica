# mathematica
Game plan for presentation

Essentially, we will be live coding for the majority of the presentation

We will start off with the simple stuff (everything is a function, we can set variables to anything, we can evaluate anything at any point, things are organized in clusters, etc)
Then move onto free form writing (Integral of 2sin(2x) === Integrate[2sin(2x), x])
With this we can show how Mathematica makes use of wolfram alpha's math engine to do complicated tasks
Then move onto graphics (plots, 3d plots, image building, messing with colors)
Afterwards, internet usage (we can get information directly from the internet, like country flags, population information, distances from/to places, current phase of the moon, etc)
Finally, we will livecode a flag map and explain what the code does and how

(game plan subject to change as we learn more cool stuff about mathematica)
(also subject to change based on the capabilities of the school computers, as we still have to test mathematica on them)
